                            say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took
                            my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack 100% recommend! ”</p>
